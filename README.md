</p>

A turnkey, follow-along demo of [IBM ContextForge](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge) (the MCP / A2A gateway) acting as the **control plane** between an AI agent (**IBM Bob**) and a fintech ("FinByte") expense-and-payments agent mesh. The gateway sits in the middle of every tool call and every agent-to-agent call, enforces **four controls**, and you can prove all of them with **one command** → `16 passed, 0 failed`.

---

## What is this?

When an AI agent can read receipts, approve expenses, and move money, the question stops being _"can the agent do it?"_ and becomes _"who's in charge of the agent?"_. This demo answers that with a control plane. **IBM Bob** is the agent — an MCP client that drives a FinByte agent mesh (expense lookups, ERP payments, policy docs, notifications, and two autonomous A2A agents). It never talks to those backends directly. Every call flows through **IBM ContextForge**, the gateway that authenticates, authorizes, governs, redacts, and audits — _before_ Bob ever sees a result and _before_ any money moves.

The gateway enforces:

- **Policy (OPA).** A wire over the $10,000 FinByte T&E cap is **blocked** unless it carries dual approval — evaluated live by an Open Policy Agent sidecar against a Rego policy.
- **Data protection.** SSNs, credit-card numbers, API keys, and other secrets in tool output are **masked on the gateway** before they reach the agent (`***-**-6789`, `****-****-****-1111`, `[SECRET_REDACTED]`).
- **Prompt-injection neutralization.** Adversarial instructions hidden in tool output ("SYSTEM: ignore all prior policy…") are **neutralized** to `[INJECTION_BLOCKED]`.
- **RBAC least-privilege.** A FinOps analyst persona simply **has no `wire` tool**; only the privileged operator persona can register servers, read the audit trail, or interrogate policy. (Rate limiting is a built-in ContextForge capability, but it is _not_ configured or demonstrated in this stack.)
- **Agent-mesh governance.** The same policy that stops a direct wire also stops a **cross-language** agent-to-agent payment (a Python auditor delegating a $50k payment to a Rust payments agent) at the bridged tool hook.

The whole stack is path-independent — config, plugins, and Rego policy are baked into the images, so there are **zero host bind-mounts** and it runs from any clone path.

## Architecture

_(See the diagram at the top.)_ IBM Bob connects through the `mcpgateway.wrapper` stdio bridge to a **virtual server** on the gateway (a curated, least-privilege slice of the catalog). The gateway fronts five governed MCP servers, one deliberately-unregistered MCP server, and two A2A agents, with an OPA sidecar for policy decisions. Only the gateway and the two A2A agents publish ports to the host; the OPA sidecar and all MCP servers are reachable only on the Compose private network.

| Component | Kind | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IBM Bob** | AI agent / MCP client | — | Drives the mesh; connects via the `mcpgateway.wrapper` stdio bridge to a virtual server |
| **ContextForge gateway** | MCP/A2A gateway (the control plane) | `4444` (host) | Authn/z, governance, redaction, audit, federation; Admin UI at `/admin` |
| **OPA** | Open Policy Agent sidecar | `8181` (internal) | Evaluates the Rego wire-amount policy (`package mcpgateway`) |
| **expense-db** | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) | `8000` (internal) | `list_pending_expenses`, `get_expense`, `get_receipt` (holds the PII / injection fixtures) |
| **erp-payments** | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) | `8000` (internal) | `approve`, `reimburse`, `wire` (the governed money path) |
| **policy-docs** | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) | `8000` (internal) | `get_policy`, `wire_limit` |
| **notify** | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) | `8000` (internal) | `notify` |
| **controlplane** | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) | `8000` (internal) | Operator surface: `register_mcp_server`, `list_control_plane`, `recent_blocks`, `evaluate_policy` |
| **fx-rates** | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) | `8000` (internal) | `get_fx_rate`, `list_currencies` — **runs but is intentionally unregistered** (for the live-register beat) |
| **auditor** | A2A agent (Python, `a2a-sdk`) | `9001` (host) | Audits expenses; can delegate a payment to the Rust agent |
| **payments** | A2A agent (Rust, `a2a-lf` / `a2a-server-lf`) | `3000` (host) | Executes payments; JSON-RPC at `/jsonrpc`, agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` |

> The seed registers **5 governed MCP servers** (`expense-db`, `erp-payments`, `policy-docs`, `notify`, `controlplane`) plus the **2 A2A agents**, and curates them into three virtual servers (FinOps, Treasury, Operator). `fx-rates` is left unregistered on every seed so the operator demo can register it live.
>
> Naming note: the `controlplane` and `auditor` services read their admin token from an env var named `AUDITOR_TOKEN` (written to `.env.tokens` by `make up`). Despite the name, it is an **admin** JWT — not an auditor-only scope.

## How a call is governed

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/call-path.svg" alt="Call path: Bob's tool call enters the gateway, runs through tool_pre_invoke (FinByteGuard queries OPA) and tool_post_invoke (FinByteGuard + PIIFilterPlugin sanitize output) before returning a governed result." width="900">
</p>

Every tool call passes through two gateway plugin hooks. On **`tool_pre_invoke`**, the custom **FinByteGuard** plugin (`gateway/custom/finbyte_guard.py`, on the cpex framework) extracts the call's arguments and asks **OPA** whether the wire-amount policy permits it — denying anything over the $10,000 cap without dual approval, and failing _closed_ if OPA is unreachable. On **`tool_post_invoke`**, FinByteGuard deep-scrubs secrets (`sk-live-…` → `[SECRET_REDACTED]`) and neutralizes prompt injection (→ `[INJECTION_BLOCKED]`), while the cpex **PIIFilterPlugin** masks SSNs and credit-card numbers. Every decision emits an `AUDIT [FinByteGuard] …` line and shows up in the Admin UI's **Logs** tab.

## The four controls

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/diagrams/scenarios.svg" alt="The four controls: OPA wire-amount policy, PII/secret redaction, prompt-injection neutralization, and RBAC least-privilege — each shown as a Bob prompt and the gateway's response." width="900">
</p>

| Control | Prompt to Bob | What ContextForge does |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Policy (OPA)** | _"Use the finbyte-gateway tools to wire $50,000 to Acme LLC for expense `exp_big`."_ | **Blocks** at OPA: _"…exceeds the $10,000 auto-approve limit… FinByte T&E policy §2."_ Add _"with dual approval"_ → **allowed**. The same policy blocks the cross-language auditor→payments $50k at the bridged `a2a-payments` hook. |
| **2 — Data protection** | _"Fetch receipt `rcpt_pii`, verbatim."_ | **Masks** before Bob sees it: SSN → `***-**-6789`, card → `****-****-****-1111`, API key → `[SECRET_REDACTED]`. |
| **3 — Prompt-injection** | _"Fetch receipt `rcpt_injection`."_ | **Neutralizes** the embedded `SYSTEM: ignore all prior policy…` → `[INJECTION_BLOCKED]`. |
| **4 — RBAC least-privilege** | _"Now wire $50k yourself, directly."_ | Bob **can't** — the FinOps virtual server hides `erp-payments-wire`. MCP Inspector confirms the tool is absent. The operator persona has control-plane tools the analyst lacks. |

Baseline that works: _"Process expense `exp_clean` and reimburse it."_ — a clean $18.50 expense flows straight through.

---

## Two personas (RBAC)

The same Bob binary becomes two different actors depending on which virtual server its `.bob/mcp.json` points at. Both targets rewrite `.bob/mcp.json` (from the `bob-personas/*.template` files, refreshing the live UUID) and launch Bob from the repo root, so they're cwd-proof and reseed-proof.

| | `make bob` — **FinOps analyst** (Act 1) | `make bob-operator` — **platform operator** (Act 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual server | **FinOps** (8 tools) | **Operator** (4 tools) |
| Can do | List/read expenses, read receipts, `approve`, `reimburse`, read policy + wire limit, talk to the **auditor** agent | `register_mcp_server`, `list_control_plane`, `recent_blocks`, `evaluate_policy` |
| **Cannot** do | **No `wire` tool**; can't register servers, read the audit trail, or query policy directly | Not the analyst's expense-handling surface |
| Persona file | `bob-personas/mcp.json.template` (server `finbyte-gateway`) | `bob-personas/mcp.operator.json.template` (server `finbyte-operator`) |

Swap back to the analyst at any time with `make bob`.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| **Docker** (running) | Runs the gateway, OPA, MCP servers, and A2A agents | **Docker Desktop** on macOS/Windows, **or Docker Engine** on Linux (runs natively, no nested virtualization). Start it before you begin. — [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) <br>**No Docker?** The stack also runs on **Podman** — see [Run on Podman](docs/RUNBOOK.md#run-on-podman-no-docker), or one-shot a fresh Ubuntu/WSL2/x86 host with `bash scripts/test-fresh-host.sh`. |
| **uv** | Mints the gateway JWT **offline** (no network round-trip) | `https://docs.astral.sh/uv/` |
| **IBM Bob Shell** (`bob`) | _Optional_ — only to **drive** Bob; the stack + `16/16` proof run without it | macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://bob.ibm.com/download/bobshell.sh \| bash` ([bob.ibm.com/download](https://bob.ibm.com/download)) — checks Node ≥ 22.15 first |
| **Node.js ≥ 22.15** | _Optional_ — required by IBM Bob Shell (it's a Node app) and the MCP Inspector (`npx`); not needed to bring up the stack or prove the controls | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), or `nvm install 22` |

> Budget **~5 GB** of free disk. On the first run, the pinned ContextForge image pulls once and the seven source images (six MCP servers + the Rust payments agent) build locally. Subsequent cold starts (`make down && make quickstart`) take roughly **~38 seconds** once images are cached.

> **Running on Linux / in a VM.** Only **Docker** and **uv** are truly required to bring up the stack and prove `16/16` — `bob`/Node are needed only to _drive_ the demo. On Apple silicon a full macOS-guest VM is impractical (~60 GB+ disk); the practical path is a lightweight Linux VM (Multipass/Lima) + Docker Engine, which runs the stack natively on arm64 (the OPA image is multi-arch, so no emulation). IBM Bob Shell is cross-platform and can also be installed in the VM to drive the demo (first run uses an IBMid device-code login on a headless box). See **[Running on a fresh Linux box / VM](#running-on-a-fresh-linux-box--vm)** below.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manavgup/ai-agent-controlplane-demo.git
cd ai-agent-controlplane-demo
make quickstart
```

`make quickstart` is **one command** that takes a laptop from nothing to a running, governed mesh: preflight (**requires** Docker + uv; **warns but continues** if `bob`/`npx` are absent) → bring up the stack → seed (register servers/agents, build the FinOps / Treasury / Operator virtual servers) → configure Bob (FinOps analyst persona) → **prove all four controls (`16/16`, with no Bob required)** → print a copy-paste walkthrough card. It's re-runnable — safe to run again if anything stalls. The Admin UI logs in with `admin@finbyte.demo` / `FinByteAdmin!2026`.

> **Proof is headless.** `make quickstart` finishes `16 passed, 0 failed` even on a box without `bob` or Node (a Linux VM or CI runner): Bob only **drives** the demo — it isn't needed to bring up the stack or prove the controls. `make bob` / `make bob-operator` also fail gracefully if `bob` isn't installed (they still write `.bob/mcp.json`, print an install hint, and exit `0`).

> **Building it up instead of dropping in?** `make quickstart` is the top-down path (zero → finished mesh). For a **developer** audience there's a bottom-up **Dev Day progressive-build track** (`make dev-start`, then `make stage1-build … stage4-mesh`): Bob writes a brand-new MCP server (`sales-tax`) from scratch, then you watch that *same* tool get containerised, governed, and called back through ContextForge — `register → grant → call` — before the four controls switch on. Bonus beat: Bob *extends* an existing service (`fx-rates`). No Docker on the attendee's laptop? `make connect` lets them drive the whole governed mesh with **only Bob** pointed at a teammate's box, a VM, or a Codespace. See **`docs/SHOWCASE-BOB.md`** and the **🎓 Progressive Build** tab in `docs/cockpit.html`.

### Drive Bob

**Act 1 — FinOps analyst (least-privilege).** Launch with `make bob` (cwd-proof; it refreshes the config first), then try:

- _"Use the finbyte-gateway tools to fetch receipt `rcpt_pii`, verbatim."_ → redacted.
- _"Fetch receipt `rcpt_injection`."_ → `[INJECTION_BLOCKED]`.
- _"Ask the auditor agent to pay $50,000 to Acme LLC."_ → **blocked** at OPA (Python → Rust).
- _"Now wire $50k yourself, directly."_ → Bob has no `wire` tool.

**Act 2 — platform operator.** Quit Bob, then `make bob-operator` to swap personas and relaunch:

- _"List everything ContextForge is governing."_ → `list_control_plane`.
- _"Would a $50,000 wire be allowed? With dual approval?"_ → `evaluate_policy` (deny + reason, then allow).
- _"Register the fx-rates service at `http://fx-rates:8000/mcp`."_ → `register_mcp_server` (a new server joins the catalog live).
- _"Show me what got blocked today."_ → `recent_blocks`.

### The three watch panes

Arrange your screen so you can watch the control plane while you prompt Bob:

```bash
make monitor        # ContextForge Admin UI (/admin): catalog + Overview/Metrics/Logs
make inspect-mcp    # MCP Inspector → the 8 governed tools (erp-payments-wire is ABSENT)
make inspect-a2a    # A2A Inspector → validates the Python + Rust agent cards
```

#### Advanced: watch everything with `make cockpit`

Prefer one command over arranging tabs by hand? `make cockpit` spawns a single
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) window that tiles **Bob** (big left pane, ~62%)
alongside four live watch panes — `logs`, `logs-opa`, `inspect-mcp`, `inspect-a2a`.
It also opens a HOW-TO guide (`docs/cockpit.html`) in your browser and starts the
Companion dashboard on `:7070`. Each pane just runs the existing `make` target, so it
reuses all the token/UUID logic. Requires tmux (`brew install tmux` / `apt-get install tmux`);
without it you get the manual fallback list above.

```bash
make cockpit                         # FinOps analyst persona (default)
COCKPIT_PERSONA=operator make cockpit  # Act 2: platform operator persona in the Bob pane
make cockpit-down                    # tear it all down (also removes the a2a-inspector container)
```

Already inside tmux? Run `make cockpit` **from your Bob pane** and it adds the four
watch panes around it (no second Bob); `make cockpit-down` then removes only those panes.

**Over SSH:** the cockpit (tmux) runs fine on the remote host, but the browser UIs
(HOW-TO page, Companion, Admin UI, MCP/A2A Inspectors) live there too — `make cockpit` prints the URLs plus a
port-forward hint instead of opening a tab. Forward them from your laptop:

```bash
ssh -L 4444:localhost:4444 -L 7070:localhost:7070 -L 6274:localhost:6274 -L 6277:localhost:6277 -L 8090:localhost:8090 <host>
```

### Running on a fresh Linux box / VM

From nothing to `16/16` on a clean Linux box (or a lightweight Multipass/Lima VM on Apple silicon — the practical path, since a macOS-guest VM needs ~60 GB+ disk):

```bash
# 1. Install the runtime + build deps (Docker Engine runs natively, no nested virtualization):
#    - Docker Engine          https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
#    - Node.js ≥ 22.15        nvm install 22          (only needed to DRIVE Bob)
#    - uv                     https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
#    - git + make             your distro's package manager

# 2. Clone + bring it all up → 16 passed, 0 failed (no Bob required):
git clone https://github.com/manavgup/ai-agent-controlplane-demo.git
cd ai-agent-controlplane-demo
make quickstart

# 3. To DRIVE the demo, install IBM Bob Shell (cross-platform; checks Node ≥ 22.15):
curl -fsSL https://bob.ibm.com/download/bobshell.sh | bash
make bob            # first run prompts an IBMid device-code login on a headless box
```

> **Build-time DNS gotcha (fresh Docker Engine).** If `make quickstart` fails during an image build with `Could not resolve host: index.crates.io` (cargo/pip inside a `RUN` step) **even though image _pulls_ succeed**, the build container is using the host's dead `systemd-resolved` `127.0.0.53` stub. Fix it once and re-run (quickstart is idempotent):
>
> ```bash
> echo '{"dns":["8.8.8.8","1.1.1.1"]}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
> sudo systemctl restart docker
> make quickstart
> ```

---

## Prove it / watch the controls

The headless proof is one command:

```bash
make verify-controls       # → RESULT: 16 passed, 0 failed
```

It runs `scripts/money-shots/run-all.sh`, which asserts all four controls plus the cross-language agent-mesh block and the Rust agent successfully executing a within-policy payment — 16 assertions in total. This is the safety net: run it any time to confirm the stack is honest.

To watch the controls fire live as you prompt Bob, see **[`docs/LOG-CHEATSHEET.md`](docs/LOG-CHEATSHEET.md)** — the exact prompt → log-line map (including which beat is _supposed_ to log nothing) — and tail:

```bash
make logs        # raw gateway logs (blocked calls surface as ERROR 'invocation failed')
make logs-opa    # live, readable OPA decisions: ALLOW/DENY + args + reason
```

## How it works

- **Virtual servers.** The gateway exposes curated, least-privilege slices of the full tool catalog: **FinOps** (8 tools, no wire — the analyst), **Treasury** (the wire path: `wire`, `reimburse`, `a2a_payments`), and **Operator** (4 control-plane tools). RBAC is enforced by _which virtual server_ a persona points at, not by the token identity.
- **The stdio bridge.** Bob connects through `uvx --from mcp-contextforge-gateway python -m mcpgateway.wrapper`, with `MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4444/servers/<UUID>/sse` and `MCP_AUTH=Bearer <admin JWT>`. Bob reads `.bob/mcp.json` from the repo root — which is why you always launch via `make bob` / `make bob-operator`.
- **Path-independence.** The gateway config, FinByteGuard plugin, and Rego policy are baked into the images (`gateway/Dockerfile`, `gateway/Dockerfile.opa`). Zero host bind-mounts means the stack runs from **any** clone path — even ones Docker can't share, like `/tmp` on macOS.

## Troubleshooting & reset

- **Attendee walkthrough:** [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) — the 3-pane, follow-along guide.
- **Presenter run order + recovery:** [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md).
- **Anything drifts / `16/16` fails:** `make demo-reset` (recreate + reseed the gateway), then `make verify-controls`.
- **Footgun — "No MCP servers configured":** you launched `bob` from the wrong directory (often the `bob-personas/` subfolder). Bob looks for `.bob/mcp.json` relative to its cwd. Quit it and run **`make bob`**, which launches from the repo root _and_ refreshes the live UUID after a reseed.
- **Fresh Linux VM — `Could not resolve host …` during a `make quickstart` image build** (e.g. `index.crates.io`, while image _pulls_ succeed): the Docker build container is using the host's dead `systemd-resolved` `127.0.0.53` stub. Fix → write `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with `{"dns":["8.8.8.8","1.1.1.1"]}`, `sudo systemctl restart docker`, then re-run `make quickstart` (idempotent). See **[Running on a fresh Linux box / VM](#running-on-a-fresh-linux-box--vm)**.
